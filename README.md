# Modeling-Simulation

This repository is dedicated to solving various exercises and problems related to the field of modeling and simulation. Here, you'll find my solutions and implementations for different exercises given in the modeling and simulation course.

## How to run the code

### Python

To run the python code, you need to have python installed on your machine. You can download python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). After installing python, you need to install the required packages. To do so, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installing the required packages, you can run the code using the following command:

```bash
python <file_name>.py
```

If you are using linux or mac, you may need to use `python3` instead of `python` in the above command.
